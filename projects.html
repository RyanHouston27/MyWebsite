			<h2>Projects I've Worked On</h2>
			<h3><a href="https://replit.com/@RyanHouston/2023Emojis">Emoji Slot Machine</a></h3>
			<p>Requirements for an assignment I made on Replit with javascript:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Give the user a starting amount of points (100 points recommended)</li>
				<li>When you run out of points, the game can no longer be played, text should show on the screen "Better luck next time, you are out of money. Go home, gambling is bad for your bank account.", and the user has to refresh the page to play again</li>
				<li>Change the background color when certain things happen: no matches, 2 matches, 3 matches, game over - out of money, new high funds amount - new high score</li>
				<li>Any and all funds have the $ in front of it.</li>
